  <div class="div2">Note what is the desktop and mobile view and which of the site is adaptive/responsive/native design ?

    In my view, Autohut is a responsive website and looks as users want to see from the destop and mobile 
    point of view. Even when we do the mobile view then on the right side there is a there lines when we click 
    on those the navigation slide down can be seen there.
  </div>
  <div class="div3">  Note which resolution and like and dislike about mobile view?
    
  The resolution for the desktop for this site starts from 1440px*900px and varies accoding to the desktop size.
  Also, for the mobile view it depends on the mobile type for example:for this site iphone has resolution approximately 375px*667px.
  Moreover, the thing I like to the mobile view is that designing to look astonishing but for this one I do not like the most content is not the home page. 
  </div>
  
 
  <div class="div5">  
    Anything Woule like to change to mobile experience?
    If I would be the one to change something in the mobile view then the slide menu that is on the right 
    I will desighn that on the left for easy to access.
