  <div class="div2"> Note what is the desktop and mobile view and which of the site is adaptive/responsive/native design ?
    
This site is also a responsive site as well as flexible as well. Most attractive in the mobile view is to see the content 
when we scroll down to the page with the slide navigation the left.</div>
  <div class="div3"> Note which resolution and like about mobile view?
    The resolution for desktop for 22 inch desktop starts from 1680px*1050px and for mobile resolution it varies
from phone to phone but for samsung it is 360px*640px. Moreover, I like for mobile view for this site is that
It has various option for the languages which eliminate the language barrier for the visitors. Also a search button 
so there is no need to scroll the whole page. </div>
  <div class="div4"> Note what dislike about the mobile view?
    There are lots of pictures on the every page of the site and less content to get information.
So, more pictures looks boring to scroll. Even not explained the things properly.</div>
 
  <div class="div5">  
    Note anything Woule like to change to mobile experience?
    Actually, If there will be chance to replace anything then unnecessary pictures should be removed from the content
    to give the site fabulous look to escalate visitors as well.
