  <div class="div2"> Note what is the desktop and mobile view and which of the site is adaptive/responsive/native design ?

    This site, Pure center nutrition is a responsive/adaptive website and looks perfect with the cart option on the right side and slide menu with that.
     If we look on the logo that really looks nice as users want to notice on one side of the page without any mess. </div>
  <div class="div3"> Note which resolution and like and dislike about mobile view?
    
    The resolution for the desktop for this site starts from 1600px*900px and varies accoding to the desktop size.
    Also, mobile resolution may be diffrent for every brand  for example:for this site BlackBerry has resolution approximately 320px*480px.
    The thing that is noticeable in this site is the content is limited whatever user needs specificially as per their choice.
  In fact, no unnecessary material.   </div>
  
 
  <div class="div5">  
   Note anything Woule like to change to mobile experience?
   I think that needs change is the search bar should be small and should be place with the search icon in the 
   mobile view. As well as, for register/log in link should be on the top. If I will get opportunity then I would like to do these changes in the site.
