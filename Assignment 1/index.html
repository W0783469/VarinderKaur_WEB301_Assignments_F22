<p>These images that I choose to add in this responsive page is of nature at outside of my house.
  Actually, I was standing ouside at my house looking at the nature because at that time weather
  was so cool and mesmerizing that I want to enjoy the nature to my heart's content. So that is why,
  I cliked that picture to capture that moment.</p>
      
	  
	  <p>I am nature lover. I usually enjoy the happenings of the nature whenever I feel bored because 
      outside fresh air give me relief and even acts as a stressbustor foe me which helps me to do my further
      work with full of concentration.
      However, too much windy day sometimes irritate me specially when there is cold outside. It freeze me,
      so owing to that I always ignored to come outside at that time when there is no emergency. Regardsless 
      all this, I love the nature to the most.
