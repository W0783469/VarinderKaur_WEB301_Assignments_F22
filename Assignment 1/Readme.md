 First of all, I created a repository on the github.com.
 Then I created a new branch on the github repository that i created and named it as Assignment 1.
 Afterwards, i download the starter files provided by the instructor, unzip that and added 
 all the files(index.html, css folder and script.js) to the github repository.

 I clicked two images with my own device of nature one of them is landscape and other is portrait.
